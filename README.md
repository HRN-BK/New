# Note and Game Modification App

This simple web application allows users to register or log in, create notes and modify basic game parameters. All data is stored in the browser's `localStorage` so it works offline.

## Features

- Email/password registration and login (stored locally).
- Create, edit and delete notes with a basic rich text area.
- Search notes by title or content.
- Modify game values such as score, level and item list.

To run the app, open `index.html` in a modern browser.
